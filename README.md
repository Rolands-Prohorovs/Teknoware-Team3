# Team 3:
## 👀Project scope:

Focus on the project is to create and implement smart light system in the trains. Specifically, the project will cover:
   - automatic light adjustment
   - location-based customization
   - data fetching and timing
   - device capabilitie

## 📍Project goals:

 - program light controller and sensors
 - implement light controller
 - enhance human comfort and well-being
 - optimize energy usage

## 🗺️Roadmap:

- make research about controller and find most suitabe for the project - 2 week
- program controller and sensors for our needs - 1 month
   - System Architecture
   - Database Design
   - API Development
- test controller and light - 2 weeks
- implement project - 2-3 days

## 🛠️Tools:

**Communication platforms:** <br>
  - Whatsapp <br> 
  - Microsoft Teams <br>
  
**Coding:** <br>
  - Visual Studio Code <br>
  - Microsoft Azure <br>
  - GitHub <br>
  - Postman <br>

**Controller**<br>
  - ESP32 (microcontroller for reading info from sensors)

  - PIR motion detector (for checking is there people on the train, so light can turn off when there is nobody)

## 🖥️Data source:
  - OpenWeatherMap - for fetching info about sunset, sunrise, time.

**Security protocols:**
- HTTPS / TLS

Questions:
1. Do we make button on the light for turning it off and also with 3 level of brightness. Or QR code with app or website for regulating? 
2. Do lights have battaries or they are powered by wire?
3. What light do we use led or regular?
4. Do we need db with light working hours?
